    "## Recap on Predictive Modelling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike econometrics, the objetive is to predict, rather than explain;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hence, the importance of having a test set to assess the model accuracy and precision;\n",
    "\n",
    "- A key step in predictive modelling is finding a good balance of model complexity, that is: if the model is to simple, it will fail to capture important information, while if it is too complex it will let the noise of the data influence it too much;\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A good way to control for this issue is through regularization (i.e. imposing a penalty on the magnitude/number of the parameters);\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A good way to assess the balanced model is through checking bias-variance results (roughly, the performance on test and training sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Usually, increasing test sample performance comes at a cost in terms of error in the training sample\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks - Multi-layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural networks are a family of flexible predictive models composed of multiple interconnected neurons;\n",
    "\n",
    "- State-of-art performance in problems involving high-dimensional (text, image) and unstructured data (i.e. 3d matrix such as images Height x Width x Color Density);\n",
    "\n",
    "- A network is composed of many simple non-linear functions: $y_{iu}$ = $f_u$( $x_i$ ; $beta_u$ ) = $sigma$ ($x_i$ * $beta_u$);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where $x_i$ and $β_u$ are k-dimensional vectors +1 for the constant 1 and σ is a non-linear activation function;\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a network, an units output is not the output of the model, but an intermediate step/transformation of the input;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers** $f^{(1)}$,...,$f^{(L-1)}$ compute recursively intermediate transformations of the input;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Layer** $f^{(L)}$ produces the model prediction from the input it received a from $f^{(L-1)}$;\n",
    "\n",
    "- These units can be seen as capturing the functional form from the data i.e. non-linearities and interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activations are chosen to help optimisation e.g. differentiable, monotonous, zero-centred, efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "    - when the derivative has a small interval, we can incur in vanishing gradient, leading to a disfunctional NN\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ReLU came to replace Sigmoid function, as they are simpler to compute and have a higher range when differentiated\n",
    "\n",
    "- If network is too large, but properly trained, overfitting shall not be a concern\n"
