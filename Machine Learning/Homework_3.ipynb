    "## Homework: Week 3 - Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Features & Scaling\n",
    "- Use these features for clustering:\n",
    "  - Annual Income (k$)\n",
    "  - Spending Score (1-100)\n",
    "- Build X with those columns.\n",
    "- Standardize with StandardScaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: K‑Means: Choose K (Elbow & Silhouette)\n",
    "1. Elbow method:\n",
    "- For $K = 1$ to $10$, fit K‑Means on scaled data and record inertia (WCSS).\n",
    "- Plot WCSS vs K.\n",
    "2. Silhouette score:\n",
    "- For $K = 2$ to $10$, compute Silhouette Score.\n",
    "- Plot Silhouette Score vs K.\n",
    "3. Briefly discuss which K looks reasonable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Final K‑Means Model (K = 5) & Strategy\n",
    "- Fit K‑Means with $K=5$ on the scaled data.\n",
    "- Add the cluster labels to the original DataFrame.\n",
    "- Make a scatter plot:\n",
    "  - x-axis: Annual Income (k$)\n",
    "  - y-axis: Spending Score (1-100)\n",
    "  - Color by cluster and show centroids.\n",
    "- Create a small table: for each cluster, show mean Age, Annual Income, Spending Score and cluster size.\n",
    "- Write some comments for each of your 5 clusters:\n",
    "  - Who is in the cluster (age, income, spending pattern)?\n",
    "  - What can be the strategy for them (e.g., products, marketing focus)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5: DBSCAN on Mall Customers\n",
    "- Use the same 2 features: Annual Income (k\\$) and Spending Score (1-100) (scaled).\n",
    "- Run DBSCAN (try to find the optimal $\\epsilon$ using the k-Distance Graph with MinPts calculated using the rule of thumb in the slide).\n",
    "- Pick one $\\epsilon$ in the knee area that gives a reasonable number of clusters plus maybe some noise.\n",
    "- Plot customers:\n",
    "  - x-axis: Income\n",
    "  - y-axis: Spending Score\n",
    "  - Color by DBSCAN cluster, noise as black.\n",
    "- Create a small table: for each cluster, show mean Age, Annual Income, Spending Score and cluster size. Compare these clusters with those from K-Means.\n",
    "- Identify some outliers and give comments about them.\n",
    "- Give some comments comparing K‑Means vs DBSCAN for this dataset:\n",
    "  - Which is easier to tune?\n",
    "  - Which gives more interpretable segments for marketing?\n",
    "  - Which would you use for this segmentation task, and why?\n"
